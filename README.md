# ChatBot

A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet. These programs are often powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and use natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user inputs in a way that mimics human conversation. Chatbots can be integrated into various platforms, such as websites, messaging apps, or social media, to provide users with information, answer questions, perform tasks, or engage in simple conversations.
